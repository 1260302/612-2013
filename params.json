The build process is as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ ucpp init               #run once\r\n    $ ucpp configure          #run each time the files in the project have changed\r\n    $ make                    #compile and link all code (debug)\r\n    $ make DEBUG_MODE=0       #compile and link all code (release)\r\n    $ make deploy             #deploy code to robot \r\n\r\n### Configuring\r\n\r\n> * When imaging it is necessary to select the option for WindRiver C++, and please enable NetConsole (except for in perhaps release builds).\r\n> * Remember that the cRIO runs an ftp server that allows anonymous ftp access.\r\n> * The robot needs to be imaged with version 43 of the firmware to be legal.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nAll code in this project is licensed under the ISC License (see 'LICENSE.rst')\r\nand is Copyright Â© 2013 Chantilly Robotics unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nA full list of contributors is in 'AUTHORS.rst'.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nThanks go out to nikitakit and all the other developers of the [ucpp][1] project.\r\nThanks to [github][2] for providing hosting of our code.\r\nAnd finally, a big thanks to the entire organization of [FIRST][3].\r\n\r\n[0]: http://anidev.github.com/612-2013/docs/html\r\n[1]: https://github.com/nikitakit/ucpp\r\n[2]: https://github.com/\r\n[3]: http://usfirst.org/\r\n","name":"612-2013","tagline":"FRC Team 612 Chantilly Robotics code for the 2013 competition (Ultimate Ascent)"}
