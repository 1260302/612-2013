The build process is as follows:\r\n\r\n`  $ ucpp init               #run once\r\n  $ ucpp configure          #run each time the files in the project have changed\r\n  $ make                    #compile and link all code (debug)\r\n  $ make DEBUG_MODE=0       #compile and link all code (release)\r\n  $ make deploy             #deploy code to robot `\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding ucpp, see 'ucpp.rst'.\r\n\r\nConfiguring\r\n++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\n - When imaging it is necessary to select the option for WindRiver C++, and please\r\n   enable NetConsole (except for in perhaps release builds).\r\n - Remember that the cRIO runs an ftp server that allows anonymous ftp access.\r\n - The robot needs to be imaged with version 43 of the firmware to be legal.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nAll code in this project is licensed under the ISC License (see 'LICENSE.rst')\r\nand is Copyright |c| 2013 Chantilly Robotics unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nA full list of contributors is in 'AUTHORS.rst'.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n++++++++++++++++\r\nThanks go out to nikitakit and all the other developers of the ucpp_ project.\r\nThanks to github_ for providing hosting of our code.\r\nAnd finally, a big thanks to the entire organization of FIRST_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.. _`FIRST Team 612 Chantilly Robotics`: http://www.chantillyrobotics.org/\r\n.. _ucpp: https://github.com/nikitakit/ucpp\r\n.. _github: https://github.com/\r\n.. _FIRST: http://usfirst.org/\r\n.. |c| unicode:: 0xA9 ..
